\chapter{Problem Description}
\section{Description}
Video Games are becoming more and more complicated with each new release, supporting different visual effects and physical simulation
to enhance the player's immersion, among these effects are deformation. 
Mesh deformation can happen in a lot of different cases, for instance in a car game, when cars crash into each other they might
end up with a deformed model as a response to the collision. \todo{Add picture}
Other examples are materials that are deformed upon interaction, like how the snow deforms in God of War\footnote{God of War Snow Deformation Video: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEgY9k89s3o}}, flags waving in the wind, or plants moving as characters collide with them, only to bounce back upon leaving the collision.

Realistic mesh deformations has long existed in other mediums such as animated films.
These mediums have the advantage that they can be rendered offline and rendering time of a couple of hours per frame
it not considered a problem. Because of this films can make use of analytical real life physics models to create realistic behavior.
In the case where they need to use approximations and computational models they can afford to spend a lot of time and resources on
the simulation process, to end up with a satisfying result.
However, this is not feasible within an interactive application, where the high framerates are a necessity for a functioning,
comfortable and immersive experience. As a result games and other interactive mediums where total realism is not a necessity
have looked at other solutions that create plausible results given the constraints of the environment.

\section{Approaches}
Several different approaches exists for mesh deformation.
For example it is possible to offline pre-computations, i.e. create common deformations for collisions offline, and apply the deformation or switch to the model with the deformation upon collision. 
This can be a good strategy in situations where the deformation will happen so fast the switch is unnoticeable to the user.
An example here could be in the case of a high-speed car-crash, upon impact the user will probably not notice that the car they are sitting in instantly got deformed,
rather than it happening by continuous collision with the other object, especially if the switch is covered a bit with some particle effects as a result of the collision.
Ideally, if you pre-compute models you should try to ensure that there is enough variations so that the user feel that the different deformations are valid enough.


\think{
* Where can this approach work well?
    * In cases where the deformation happens so fast that the user don't really notice until it is finished
    * Places where you have predictable deformations, or the user don't notice the repeat of them.

* Offline pre-computations (i.e. Create common deformations offline, and switch to those upon collision)
    * Modal Analysis with Constraints \url{https://twvideo01.ubm-us.net/o1/vault/gdc04/slides/fast_yet_realistic.pdf} 
* Finite Element Method
    * Too resource demanding in 2002, might be better now
* FDD (Free Form Deformation)
* Mass Spring Systems
