{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Done for various reasons: Collision response, animation, physics emulation.
        \item Exist many solutions, with different levels of accuracy
        \item Field can be intimidating due to all the math involved
        \item Many solutions are really accurate, working well in film or non-realtime simulation
        \item Games often need to sacrifice accuracy for speed.
    \end{itemize}
