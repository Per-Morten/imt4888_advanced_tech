Mesh manipulation is a broad area, and is done for many different reasons.
Mesh manipulation can be used for collision deformation, animation, physics simulation and the likes. 
However, mesh manipulation can be quite an intimidating to approach, due to the mathematical intensity of the field.
This paper presents a discussion on mesh deformation through spring-mass systems, and also presents two implementations for mesh deformation,
using the spring mass damper model. One with semi-implicit euler integration, the other using verlet integration and constraints.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Done for various reasons: Collision response, animation, physics emulation.
        \item Exist many solutions, with different levels of accuracy
        \item Field can be intimidating due to all the math involved
        \item Many solutions are really accurate, working well in film or non-realtime simulation
        \item Games often need to sacrifice accuracy for speed.
    \end{itemize}
