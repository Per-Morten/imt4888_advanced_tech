\section{Spring Mesh Damping}
The spring mesh damping model is usually presented in a quite intuitive manner. 
Each vertex is considered a point with its own mass. 
Between the vertices are springs which try to hold the whole mesh together.
When no forces are applied to the particles within the model, the springs are in their natural position, known as resting position.
