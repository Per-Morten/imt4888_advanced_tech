%% This document gives an example on how to use the ntnumasterthesis
%% LaTeX document class.

%% Use short name MACS, MIS, CIMET, MTDMT, MIXD or MIS
%% Language english or norsk
%% b5paper with oneside or twoside, you can set A4 if you want but you submit in b5

%% If you want print with the heading material on a4 paper you can use this format
%% \documentclass[MACS,english,a4paper,oneside,12pt]{ntnuthesis/ntnuthesis}

%% with the change to using DAIM we have a new option. include DAIM after english below removes the front page material so that you can then submit in the DAIM system. If you are wanting the front material remove DAIM and make sure you fill in the DaimData.tex file.

    Possible topics to cover:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Human muscles can be modelled as spring system, brain sets desired spring length.
        \item Hybrid systems (Raw spring mass in just cause, but it is further fixed with algorithms)
        \item Give an overview of the prep (Do in reflection)
        \item Cover mesh deformation as springs
        \item Cover mesh manipulation as physical objects with constraints (cloth)
        \item Bring up papers that I was pointed at which was hard to understand.
        \item Comment on both kinetic and dynamic (don't need cover)
        \item Cover Doing it on the CPU, doing it on the GPU (in Shaders) (don't need to cover)

\think{Add in that shape generation can be a smart thing to do to get a better overview of how everything fits together.}
\think{Should I focus more on the usage of mass spring models, and discuss what they can be used for, i.e. not just going for mesh manipulation, but also other types of physical simulations?}
